You can manage the employees for your business using the software programme known as your JDBC-based Employee Management System. You can do a number of actions on the system's user-friendly interface, including adding, deleting, updating, and querying employee records from a main database.

The system interacts with the database and performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) actions on the employee records using the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API. Additionally, it makes use of MySQL Database.


By inputting their id, name, address and salary , the user interface offers a straightforward and intuitive approach to create employee records. Similar to this, removing a database record for an employee and we can perform update and search operations too.
